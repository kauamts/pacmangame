### Mac Installation

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Using Homebrew (recommended)
   brew install python3
   
   # Or download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   ```

2. **Clone or download this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pacman-game
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install pygame directly:
   ```bash
   pip3 install pygame
   ```

## How to Run

### Method 1: Direct Python Execution
```bash
python3 pacman_game.py
```

### Method 2: Using the Launch Script
```bash
./run_game.sh
```

### Method 3: Mac App Bundle (Recommended for Mac)
1. Create the Mac app bundle:
   ```bash
   python3 create_mac_app.py
   ```
2. Double-click `PacMan.app` in Finder to launch the game
3. The app will feel like a native Mac application!

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move PacMan up, down, left, right
- **R**: Restart game (when game over or victory)
- **Close Window** or **Escape**: Quit game

## Gameplay

1. **Objective**: Collect all the white dots in the maze while avoiding the colored ghosts
2. **Movement**: Use arrow keys or WASD to navigate through the maze
3. **Dots**: Small white dots give you 10 points each
4. **Power Pellets**: Large white dots (in corners) give you 50 points and make ghosts scared (blue) for 10 seconds
5. **Eating Ghosts**: While ghosts are scared, you can eat them for 200 points each
6. **Lives**: You start with 3 lives. Touching a non-scared ghost costs you a life
7. **Victory**: Collect all dots to complete the level
8. **Game Over**: Lose all 3 lives and the game ends

## Game Elements
